# [4.0.0](https://github.com/thenativeweb/typedescriptor/compare/3.0.2...4.0.0) (2021-05-07)


### Features

* Rewrite library with focus on small type-guard functions. ([#296](https://github.com/thenativeweb/typedescriptor/issues/296)) ([91ef31d](https://github.com/thenativeweb/typedescriptor/commit/91ef31d82dd4e01ed5f959a2d1470062b351849b))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The entire API is different. There is no `Typedescriptor` class anymore,
just a bunch of type-guard functions and one function that returns a
variable's type as a string.
